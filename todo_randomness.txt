How Randomness Works in the AthenaK 2D MRI Problem Generator
=============================================================

File: athenak/src/pgen/mri2d.cpp
Input: athenak/inputs/shearing_box/mri2d.athinput

Current Behavior
----------------
The MRI initial conditions include random pressure perturbations to seed
the instability. The random number generator is a Kokkos XorShift64 pool,
seeded with the global MeshBlock ID (pmbp->gids):

    Kokkos::Random_XorShift64_Pool<> rand_pool64(pmbp->gids);

Each cell gets a perturbation:

    Real rval = 1.0 + amp*(rand_gen.frand() - 0.5);

where "amp" is read from the <problem> block of the input file.

The seed is deterministic: same mesh configuration = same initial
perturbations every time. There is currently no user-configurable
random seed parameter.

Problem
-------
If you want to run e.g. 500 simulations with different random
realizations of the same physical setup, you cannot do so without
modifying the code. Re-running the same input file produces identical
initial conditions.

Proposed Fix
------------
Add a user-configurable seed parameter in mri2d.cpp. The change is
small (two lines):

  1. Read a new integer parameter "rseed" from the <problem> block:

       int rseed = pin->GetOrAddInteger("problem","rseed",0);

  2. Mix it into the RNG seed:

       Kokkos::Random_XorShift64_Pool<> rand_pool64(pmbp->gids + rseed);

  The parameter defaults to 0 so existing input files are unaffected.

  Then add to the input file's <problem> block:

       rseed = 42    # any integer; different values -> different perturbations

Generating 500 Runs
-------------------
After making the code change, create 500 input files with different seeds:

    for i in $(seq 0 499); do
      sed "s/rseed.*=.*/rseed = $i/" mri2d.athinput > runs/mri2d_${i}.athinput
    done

If rseed is not yet in the template input file, use an append approach:

    for i in $(seq 0 499); do
      cp mri2d.athinput runs/mri2d_${i}.athinput
      echo "rseed = $i" >> runs/mri2d_${i}.athinput
    done

(Parameters can appear anywhere in their block; appending to the end
of the file works as long as the last block in the file is <problem>,
otherwise insert it into the <problem> block directly.)

You can also vary physics parameters (beta, amp, ifield, nwx) across
runs without any code changes -- those are already read from the input
file.

Notes
-----
- The same approach applies to mri3d.cpp (athenak/src/pgen/tests/mri3d.cpp),
  which uses the same seeding mechanism.
- The seed combines with gids, so runs on different mesh decompositions
  (e.g. different numbers of MeshBlocks) will already produce different
  perturbations even with the same rseed value.
